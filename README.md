# lazyninjacat.github.io

Matthew Riddett personal website
Version 1

I built this version of the site with HTML, JS, JQuery and SASS/CSS. I used it as a way to learn fundamental web design and core web dev languages and toolsets.

Deployed with Netlify, version control with Git through Github.

Sass is organized according to the 7 folders 1 file rule, with main.scss importing all other .scss files.

Javascript is all housed in one file - home.js
